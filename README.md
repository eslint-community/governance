# Governance

Outlines the governance of [@eslint-community](https://github.com/eslint-community) and fascilitates proposals and nominations

## Goal

As you can read in the
["`eslint-community` GitHub organization" RFC](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/tree/main/designs/2022-community-eslint-org),
the goal of this organization is to have a place where community members can
help ensure widely depended upon ESLint-related packages live and never fall out
of maintenance.
